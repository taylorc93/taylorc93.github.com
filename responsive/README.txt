Lab 4

This lab demonstrates how to use media queries to adjust screen layout for different
devices

1. Everything in this lab seems to be working (Dice will show up on an iPhone 4 with 
a width of 480px and a height of 940px)
2. Every part of this lab was done solely by me.
3. This lab took me about 3 hours to complete, although about 2 1/2 of them were spent
resolving technical difficulties with git (it kept telling me that I had failed to 
complete a merge, so I finally found a way to force my push to go through).  This is also
why I am submitting this so late, I thought that it had been submitted properly and then
realized while i was adding files for assignment 1 that my lab4 folder was missing.
