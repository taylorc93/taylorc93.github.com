Assignment 1:

This is my personal webpage that holds information about me relevant to job applications.
There are three pages; The homepage, my resume, and a short bio.

1. Every part of this project seems to be working correctly.  *IMPORTANT NOTE* There are 
   a few minor things that must be noted about my resume.  There is no activities section 
   because there aren't really any activities that I do that relate to computer science
   outside of practicing on my own. This is also why I don't have accomplishments listed
   under my previous work experience.
2. I have worked alone on this project, although I did consult some external websites to
   figure out how to do certain things in CSS.
3. This project has currently taken me about 5 hours
