Assignment 1:

This is my personal webpage that holds information about me relevant to job applications.
There are three pages; The homepage, my resume, and a short bio.

1. Every part of this project seems to be working correctly. The mobile.css stylesheet is
   designed for the iphone 4. 
   *IMPORTANT NOTE* 
   There are a few minor things to note about my resume.  There is no activities section 
   because there aren't any activities that I do related to computer science outside of 
   practicing on my own. This is also why I don't have accomplishments listed under my 
   previous work experience. Also, I noticed that all of my html files were only
   tentatively accepted as valid.  I don't know if this is bad, but I had no errors so I
   assumed this meant that things were ok.
   
2. I have worked alone on this project, although I did consult some external websites to
   figure out how to do certain things in CSS (e.g. how to make the background cover the 
   whole page).
   
3. This assignment took me approximately 10 hours to complete over 4-5 days.
